# Available Nodes

## Image Generation Nodes
These nodes create high-quality images from text or image prompts, generating photorealistic or artistic results with support for various aspect ratios.

| Node                   | Description                                                        |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Text2Image Base**    | Generates images from text prompts, serving as the foundation for text-based image creation. |
| **Text2Image Fast**    | Optimized for speed, this node generates images from text prompts with faster results while maintaining quality. |
| **Text2Image HD**      | Optimized for high-resolution outputs, this node generates detailed and sharp visuals from text prompts. |
| **Reimagine**          | Guides image generation using both prompts and an input image. Preserve the original structure and depth while introducing new materials, colors, and textures. |

## Tailored Generation Nodes
These nodes use pre-trained tailored models to generate images that faithfully reproduce specific visual IP elements or guidelines.

| Node                   | Description                                                        |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Tailored Gen**       | Generates images using a trained tailored model, reproducing specific visual IP elements or guidelines. Use the Tailored Model Info node to load the model's default settings. |
| **Tailored Model Info** | Retrieves the default settings and prompt prefix of a trained tailored model, which can be used to configure the Tailored Gen node. |

## Image Editing Nodes
These nodes modify specific parts of images, enabling adjustments while maintaining the integrity of the rest of the image.

| Node                   | Description                                                        |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **RMBG 2.0 (Remove Background)** | Removes the background from an image, isolating the foreground subject. |
| **Replace Background**  | Replaces an imageâ€™s background with a new one, guided by either a reference image or a prompt. |
| **Expand Image**        | Expands the dimensions of an image, generating new content to fill the extended areas. |
| **Eraser**             | Removes specific objects or areas from an image by providing a mask. |
| **GenFill**            | Generates objects by prompt in a specific region of an image. |
| **Erase Foreground**    | Removes the foreground from an image, isolating the background. |

## Product Shot Generation Nodes
These nodes create high-quality product images for eCommerce workflows.

| Node                   | Description                                                        |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ShotByText**         | Modifies an image's background by providing a text prompt. Powered by BRIA's ControlNet Background-Generation. |
| **ShotByImage**        | Modifies an image's background by providing a reference image. Uses BRIA's ControlNet Background-Generation and Image-Prompt. |

# Installation
There are two methods to install the BRIA ComfyUI API nodes:

### Method 1: Using ComfyUI's Custom Node Manager
1. Open ComfyUI.
2. Navigate to the [**Custom Node Manager**](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager).
