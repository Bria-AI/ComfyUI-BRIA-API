This repository provides custom nodes for ComfyUI, enabling direct access to **BRIA's API endpoints** for image generation workflows. **API documentation** is available [**here**](https://bria-ai-api-docs.redoc.ly/#operation//generation/bria-v2/text-to-image). 

An API token is required to use the nodes in your workflows. Get started quickly here

# Available Nodes

## Image Generation Nodes

### **Text2Image Base Node**
This node generates images from text prompts, serving as the foundation for creating visuals based on descriptive input. [[ðŸ¤—model card](https://huggingface.co/briaai/BRIA-2.3)]

## Tailored Generation Nodes
These nodes use pre-trained tailored models to generate images that faithfully reproduce specific visual IP elements or guidelines. [[API docs](https://bria-ai-api-docs.redoc.ly/tag/Tailored-Generation)].

### **Tailored Gen**
This node generates images using a trained tailored model, reproducing specific visual IP elements or guidelines. Use the Tailored Model Info node to load the model's default settings.

### **Tailored Model Info**
This node retrieves the default settings and prompt prefix of a trained tailored model, which can be used to configure the Tailored Gen node.

## Image Editing Nodes
These nodes modify specific parts of images, enabling adjustments, while maintaining the integrity of the rest of the image.[[API docs](https://bria-ai-api-docs.redoc.ly/tag/Image-Editing)]

### **Eraser**
This node is used to remove specific objects or areas from an image by providing a mask. Powered by BRIA's ControlNet inpainting [[ðŸ¤—model card](https://huggingface.co/briaai/BRIA-2.3-ControlNet-Inpainting)] [[ðŸ¤—HF demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/briaai/BRIA-Eraser-API)].

### **GenFill**
This node is used to generate objects by prompt in a specific region of an image. This functionality is powered by BRIA's ControlNet Generative Fill. [[ðŸ¤—model card](https://huggingface.co/briaai/BRIA-2.3-ControlNet-Generative-Fill)] [[ðŸ¤—HF demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/briaai/BRIA-Generative-Fill-API)]

## Product Shot Generation Nodes
These nodes create high-quality product images for eCommerce workflows. [[API docs](https://bria-ai-api-docs.redoc.ly/tag/Product-Shots-Generation)]

### **ShotByText**
This node is used to modify the background in an image by providing a prompt, This functionality is powered by BRIA's ControlNet Background-Generation.[[ðŸ¤—ContrlNet model card](https://huggingface.co/briaai/BRIA-2.3-ControlNet-BG-Gen)] [[ðŸ¤—HF demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/briaai/Product-Shot-Generation)].

### **ShotByImage**
This node is used to modify the background in an image by providing a reference image. This functionality is powered by BRIA's ControlNet Background-Generation and BRIA's Image-Prompt. [[ðŸ¤—ContrlNet model card](https://huggingface.co/briaai/BRIA-2.3-ControlNet-Inpainting)] [[ðŸ¤—IP-Adapter model card](https://huggingface.co/briaai/Image-Prompt)] [[ðŸ¤—HF demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/briaai/Product-Shot-Generation)].

# Installation
There are two methods to install the BRIA ComfyUI API nodes:

### Method 1: Using ComfyUI's Custom Node Manager
1. Open ComfyUI.
2. Navigate to the [**Custom Node Manager**](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager).
3. Click on 'Install Missing Nodes' or search for BRIA API and install the node from the manager.

### Method 2: Git Clone
1. Navigate to the `custom_nodes` directory of your ComfyUI installation:
   ```bash
   cd path_to_comfyui/custom_nodes
   ```
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-link/ComfyUI-BRIA-API.git
   ```

3. Restart ComfyUI and load the workflows.
